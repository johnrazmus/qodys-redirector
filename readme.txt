Powerful redirection plugin for WordPress to eliminate dependencies on popups.

== Description ==

Specifically, the Redirector plugin sends visitors leaving your website to the url 
of your choice.  While that sounds simple, it's extremely flexible and powerful, 
allowing you to choose custom urls for specific pages, posts, or sets of both.

You can send Googlers who found your cat scratching post article straight to Amazon 
to purchase one, or send everyone who leaves your homepage who didn't click your 
product link to the "no, wait!" downsell.  The true power of this plugin is how it 
can't be stopped.

Unlike annoying popups, they are taken straight away to the chosen url - avoid 
those pesky "are you sure you want to leave?" confirmation boxes.  Not only does 
this seem to increase conversion rates, but the plugin as a whole single-handedly 
increased mine by 120% across all my various niche sites - and I'm not the only one 
to see those kind of results.
