	<p>This tool lets Qody take your "not-so-great" visitors (aka. the ones that are leaving) and send them wherever you want.</p>
	<p>While it might not make entire conceptual sense, it does increase conversions by about 100%.*</p>
	<p>Unlike pop-ups, this redirect cannot be avoided and doesn't add add in extra steps for a user to
		take before being sent to the desired location. Popups require a button click; 
		Qody's redirect only requires the mouse to leave the top of the screen.</p>
